iartris
========

Yet another implementation of the classic Tetris, based on the open-source Jetris, developed in an Artificial Intelligence course.

AI functionality added on top of the original 1-player mode from Jetris. Implemented heuristics include Greedy (best current move), Lookahead (with varying search levels) and a variation of the A* algorithm.

The already existing High Score feature was tweaked to keep track of the heuristics' performance.


Development timeframe: 2 weeks.
